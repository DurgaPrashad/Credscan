## Overview

This project is a web-based, machine learning-powered system for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.  
It supports eight ML models, multiple ensemble methods, interactive visualizations, and a mobile-friendly Progressive Web App (PWA) interface.

---

## Features

- Real-time fraud prediction (sub-500ms)
- 8 ML algorithms: Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, AdaBoost
- Ensemble, weighted, and sequential prediction methods
- Responsive dashboard and mobile PWA
- CSV upload and batch analysis
- Interactive charts (Plotly.js)
- Offline support and installable app

---

## System Architecture

- **Backend:** Python Flask
- **ML:** scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Plotly.js
- **PWA:** Service Worker, Manifest
- **Model Storage:** Pickle (PKL), JSON (XGBoost)
